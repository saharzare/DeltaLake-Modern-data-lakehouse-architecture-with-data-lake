## Modern Data Lakehouse Architectures with Data Lakes - Chapter Summaries
### Chapter 1: Introduction to Delta Lake

#### Overview
Delta Lake is an open-source storage layer designed to bring **reliability** and **performance** to data lakes. It solves common data lake challenges like **data integrity, consistency, and scalability** by introducing ACID transactions and efficient metadata management.

#### Key Concepts

##### Data Warehouses vs. Data Lakes vs. Lakehouses
- **Data Warehouses**: Optimized for structured data, fast queries, but lack scalability.
- **Data Lakes**: Handle diverse data types but lack ACID guarantees, leading to inconsistencies.
- **Lakehouses**: Combine **scalability of data lakes** with **reliability of data warehouses**. **Delta Lake** is a leading Lakehouse format.
